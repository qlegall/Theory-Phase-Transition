@book{grimmett_percolation_1999,
	title = {Percolation},
	isbn = {978-3-540-64902-1},
	abstract = {Percolation theory is the study of an idealized random medium in two or more dimensions. It is a cornerstone of the theory of spatial stochastic processes with applications in such fields as statistical physics, epidemiology, and the spread of populations. Percolation plays a pivotal role in studying more complex systems exhibiting phase transition. The mathematical theory is mature, but continues to give rise to problems of special beauty and difficulty. The emphasis of this book is upon core mathematical material and the presentation of the shortest and most accessible proofs. The book is intended for graduate students and researchers in probability and mathematical physics. Almost no specialist knowledge is assumed beyond undergraduate analysis and probability. This new volume differs substantially from the first edition through the inclusion of much new material, including: the rigorous theory of dynamic and static renormalization; a sketch of the lace expansion and mean field theory; the uniqueness of the infinite cluster; strict inequalities between critical probabilities; several essays on related fields and applications; numerous other results of significant. There is a summary of the hypotheses of conformal invariance. A principal feature of the process is the phase transition. The subcritical and supercritical phases are studied in detail. There is a guide for mathematicians to the physical theory of scaling and critical exponents, together with selected material describing the current state of the rigorous theory. To derive a rigorous theory of the phase transition remains an outstanding and beautiful problem of mathematics.},

	title = {Stochastic {Geometry} and {Its} {Applications}},
	isbn = {978-1-118-65825-3},
	abstract = {An extensive update to a classic text Stochastic geometry and spatial statistics play a fundamental role in many modern branches of physics, materials sciences, engineering, biology and environmental sciences. They offer successful models for the description of random two- and three-dimensional micro and macro structures and statistical methods for their analysis. The previous edition of this book has served as the key reference in its field for over 18 years and is regarded as the best treatment of the subject of stochastic geometry, both as a subject with vital applications to spatial statistics and as a very interesting field of mathematics in its own right. This edition:  Presents a wealth of models for spatial patterns and related statistical methods. Provides a great survey of the modern theory of random tessellations, including many new models that became tractable only in the last few years. Includes new sections on random networks and random graphs to review the recent ever growing interest in these areas. Provides an excellent introduction to theory and modelling of point processes, which covers some very latest developments. Illustrate the forefront theory of random sets, with many applications. Adds new results to the discussion of fibre and surface processes. Offers an updated collection of useful stereological methods. Includes 700 new references. Is written in an accessible style enabling non-mathematicians to benefit from this book. Provides a companion website hosting information on recent developments in the field www.wiley.com/go/cskm   Stochastic Geometry and its Applications is ideally suited for researchers in physics, materials science, biology and ecological sciences as well as mathematicians and statisticians. It should also serve as a valuable introduction to the subject for students of mathematics and statistics.},

ABSTRACT="In this work, we use percolation theory to study the feasibility of
large-scale connectivity of relay-augmented device-to-device (D2D) networks
in an urban scenario, featuring a haphazard system of streets and canyon
shadowing allowing only for line-of-sight (LOS) communications in a limited
finite range. We use a homogeneous Poisson-Voronoi tessellation (PVT) model
of streets with homogeneous Poisson users (devices) on its edges and
independent Bernoulli relays on the vertices. Using this model, we
demonstrated the existence of a minimal threshold for relays below which
large-scale connectivity of the network is not possible, regardless of all
other network parameters. Through simulations, we estimated this threshold
to 71.3\%. Moreover, if the mean street length is not larger than some
threshold (predicted to 74.3\% of the communication range; which might be
the case in a typical urban scenario) then any (whatever small) density of
users can be compensated by equipping more crossroads with relays. Above
this latter threshold, good connectivity requires some minimal density of
users, compensated by the relays in a way we make explicit. The existence
of the above regimes brings interesting qualitative arguments to the
discussion on the possible D2D deployment scenarios."
